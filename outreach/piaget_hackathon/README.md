Our team won the best project prize at Piaget Hackathon. As a part of the prize, we get support from SDG Accelerator (https://gt-initiative.org/education-programs/accelerator/). 

Our plan
In the next year, we 
- develop tools to hunt for knowledge in climate (or any) reports
- create learning modules to train the hunters (people) to use the tools

With the help of the accelerator, we want to get our *open and re-usable interactive learning module for small groups* off the ground.
