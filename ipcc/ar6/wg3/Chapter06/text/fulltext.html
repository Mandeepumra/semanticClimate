The physical  infrastructure  includes  all  the  infrastructure  and  equipment  used  to  extract,  transform, transport, transmit, and convert energy to provide energy services. In addition to the physical system, a broad range of societal systems and dynamics are relevant to the energy system. Human societies use energy to transport themselves and the goods that they use and consume, to heat, cool, and light their homes, to cook their food, and to produce goods and services. Energy systems are therefore tied to the systems involved in the provision of these various goods and services. All energy users engage in the operation of energy systems by demanding energy at particular times and in particular forms. They can adjust their behaviour and demands, for example, by using less energy or by changing when they use energy.  Consumers  can  invest in  equipment  that  reduces  their  energy  needs,  and  they  can  invest  in technologies  that  transform  energy  (e.g.,  rooftop  solar)  or  store  energy  (e.g.,  batteries).  Firms  and governments invest in equipment to produce, transform, and transport energy  such as power plants, refineries, electric transmission lines, and oil tankers.

Approaches  to  energy  security are frequently driven by the scope of domestic energy resources. For example, energy security concerns have led to continued reliance on domestic coal production and consumption  (Jakob et al. 2020) and increased  investment  in  domestic  renewable  generation  (Konstantinos  &amp;  Ioannidis,  2017).

In  recent  years,  regulatory  instruments  to  promote  low-carbon infrastructure have gained traction in developing countries  (Finon 2019). The choice of policies has depended  on  institutional  capacities,  technological  maturity  and  other  developmental  priorities  of governments.  For  example,  governments  have  favoured  regulatory  instruments  over  economic </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3583">instruments  when  there  has  been  sufficient  institutional  capacity  to  implement  and  monitor  the regulations and standards (Hughes and Urpelainen 2015). Furthermore, institutional capacity has also determined  the  extent  of  implemented  measures  (Adenle  et  al.  2017).  Market  conditions  and technological maturity are other important determinants of policy mixes being deployed in the energy </span></div><div style="" id="id3600"/><div style="" id="id3711"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3712">sector.  For  example,  subsidies  for  mitigation  like  feed-in-tariffs  (FIT)  have  worked  best  when  the technologies are in nascent stages of development (Gupta et al. 2019a).  </span></div><div style="" id="id3715"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3716">On the other hand, market-based instruments like emission trading schemes (ETS) and auctions coupled with a regulatory framework have been a favourable strategy for more mature technologies (Polzin et al. 2015; Kitzing et al. 2018). FIT, tax incentives, and renewable portfolio standards - despite potentially substantial program costs (Andor and Voss 2016; Abrell et al. 2019) - have played a significant role in attracting foreign direct investments in the renewable sector (Wall et al. 2019). Subsidies and carbon pricing have also played an important role in mainstreaming these renewable energy sources (Best and Burke 2018). Recently, subsidy-free investments in renewables, e.g. wind offshore (Jansen et al. 2020), backed by power purchase agreements, have gained momentum (Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre and BNEF  2020).  Similar  considerations  apply  for  policy  mixes  targeted  to  other  sectors,  for  example transport and buildings. </span></div><div style="" id="id3727"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3728">The role of carbon pricing is still limited though increasing. Different measures have been suggested to improve the performance of the ETS, such as &#8220;price floors and caps&#8221; and other carbon pricing schemes (Bataille et al. 2018; Campiglio 2016; Goulder and Morgenstern 2018). In 2020, 61 regional, national and sub-national carbon pricing instruments, representing 22% of the global GHG emissions, were in action or scheduled for implementation (World Bank 2019). Over 51% of emissions covered are priced at less than USD 10 per tCO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id3734">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3735">-e.. At present, however, only 5% of the global emissions covered under carbon pricing initiatives are consistent with the range of carbon prices that have been suggested as needed  to  limit  warming  to  well  below  2&#176;C  (Stiglitz  and  Stern  2017).  Most  of  the  carbon  pricing schemes have taken place in the OECD countries. The limited application of carbon pricing instruments in developing, and emerging economies may be due to political economy constraints  (Campiglio 2016; Finon 2019). Carbon pricing had a sizeable impact on emissions , e.g. the EU ETS impacts emissions from electricity in Germany (Sch&#228;fer 2019) and manufacturing in France (Colmer et al.), respectively. Emission  reductions  could  be  increased  with  higher  carbon  prices  and  without  free  allocation  of allowances.  </span></div><div style="" id="id3745"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3746">In  the  absence  of  a  global  comprehensive  carbon  price,  regional  regulatory  policies  for  fossil  fuels supply and key demand sectors like transport, industry and buildings (Chapters 9-11), coupled with regional carbon pricing instruments, were implemented to help initiating the climate actions consistent with  the  Paris  agreement  (Kriegler  et  al.  2018).  However,  differences  in  the  stringency  of  climate regulation  has  triggered  fear  that  regulation  reduces  the  competitiveness  of  industries  in  regulated countries and lead to industry re-location and &#8220;carbon leakage&#8221; (Schenker et al. 2018). In recent years, however, there is little evidence of carbon leakage (Sch&#228;fer 2019; Naegele and Zaklan 2019), and even positive  effects  of  carbon  pricing  on  efficiency  have  been  observed  (e.g.,  L&#246;schel  et  al.  2019,  for German  manufacturing  firms,  and  (Germeshausen  2020)  for  German  power  plants).

Furthermore,  multiple policies - often implemented by different governmental levels (national vs subnational) - interacted with each  other  and  thereby  affected  their  environmental  and  economic  effectiveness.  Recent  examples include interactions of ETS with renewable support policies (e.g. Boehringer and Behrens 2015; Del Rio 2017), energy efficiency policies (e.g. Wiese et al. 2018) or electricity market reform (e.g. Teng et al. 2017), respectively.  </span></div><div style="" id="id3764"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3765">Apart from explicit carbon pricing, various implicit carbon pricing mechanisms such as fossil fuel taxes and removal of fossil fuel subsidies (see Box 6.3) and regulatory instruments are used by many countries as  part  of  their  climate  policies.

It has been estimated that the amount spent on fossil fuel subsidies was around double the amount of subsidies spent on renewables  (IEA 2018b).

In  some  cases,  these  energy  access  subsidies  have  helped  extend modern energy sources to the poor (Kimemia and Annegarn 2016) and thereby contribute to SDG-7. However, the subsidies have proven to be regressive in most cases, with little benefit reaching the poor (Lockwood 2015). For example, Indonesia has introduced liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidies for cooking. The kerosene to LPG conversion program (&#8220;Zero Kero&#8221;) was launched in 2007 and provided mainly households with free initial LPG equipment and LPG at a low subsidized price (Thoday et al. 2018;  Imelda  et  al.  2018b).  Besides  the  national  government,  provincial  governments  and  industry played a crucial role in implementation. Overall, the LPG conversion program in Indonesia reduced cooking kerosene use (Andadari et al. 2014; Imelda et al. 2018b) and GHG emissions (Permadi et al. 2017) with positive health effects (Thoday et al. 2018; Imelda et al. 2018b). However, the program is generally viewed as regressive and has failed to reduce traditional solid fuel use (Andadari et al. 2014; Toft 2016; Thoday et al. 2018). Furthermore, even if the program decreased greenhouse gas emissions relative to continued kerosene use, these subsidies are still targeted at fossil fuels and contribute to GHG emissions.  </span></div><div style="" id="id3952"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3953">India started a large LPG program in 2015 that provided a capital cost subsidy to poor households (e.g. Kar et al. 2019; Jose et al. 2018; Gould 2018). While the program has increased adoption of LPG in India (e.g. Sharma et al. 2019), it has not yet achieved a sustained use of LPG and replacement of solid fuels for cooking, amplifying the need for complementary policy measures  ( Gould 2018; Kar et al. 2019; Mani et al. 2020). The climate impacts of switching from biomass to LPG depend on the degree of  biomass  combustion  in  stoves  and  the  extent  to  which  biomass  originates  from  non-renewable sources (Jose et al. 2018; Singh and Rao 2015). Barriers to increasing LPG use for cooking further included abundance of solid fuels at zero (monetary) costs (Mani et al. 2020) as well as benefits of solid fuels, such as maintaining the traditional taste of food and space heating in colder seasons (Gould 2018; </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3963">Sharma et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id3965"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3966">[END BOX 6.3 HERE] </span></div><div style="" id="id3980"/>

These recent values are an order of magnitude lower than coal and natural gas and further decarbonization of the energy system will make them lower still. Thin films and organics produce half the life-cycle emissions of silicon wafer PV, mainly because they use less material (Lizin et al. 2013; Hou et al. 2016). Novel materials promise even lower environmental impacts, especially with improvements to their performance ratios and  reliability  (Gong  et  al.  2015;  Muteri  et  al.  2020).

Approximately  2  hectares  of  land  are  needed  for  1  MW  of  solar electricity capacity (Kabir et al. 2018; Perpi&#241;a Castillo et al. 2016); at 20% efficiency, a square of PV panels of 550 km by 550 km, comprising 0.2% of Earth&#8217;s land area, could meet global energy demand. Land conversion can have local impacts, especially near cities and where land used for solar competes with  alternative  uses, such  as  agriculture.  Large installations  can  also adversely  impact  biodiversity (Hernandez et al. 2014), especially where the above ground vegetation is cleared and soils are typically graded. Landscape fragmentation creates barriers to the movement of species. However, a variety of means  have  emerged  to  mitigate  land  use  issues.  Substitution  among  renewables  can  reduce  land conversion (Tr&#246;ndle and Trondle 2020). Solar can be integrated with other uses through &#8216;agrivoltaics&#8217; (the use of land for both agriculture and solar production) (Dupraz et al. 2011) by, for example, using shade-tolerant crops (Dinesh and Pearce 2016). Combining solar and agriculture can also create income diversification, reduced drought stress, higher solar output due to radiative cooling, and other benefits (Elamri et al. 2018; Hassanpour Adeh et al. 2018; Barron-Gafford et al. 2019). PV installations floating on water also avoid land-use conflicts (Sahu et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2020), as does dual-use infrastructure, such as landfills (J&#228;ger-Waldau 2020) and reservoirs where evaporation can also be reduced (Farfan </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4823">and Breyer 2018).  </span></div><div style="" id="id4825"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4826">Material demand for PV will likely increase substantially to limit warming to well below 2&#176;C, but PV materials are widely available, have possible substitutes, and can be recycled (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4828">medium confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4829">) (Box 6.4). The primary materials for PV are silicon, copper, glass, aluminium, and silver, the costliest being silicon and glass being the most essential by mass, at 70%. None of these materials is considered to be either critical or potentially scarce (IEA 2020e). Thin-film cells, such as amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride  and copper indium  gallium  diselenide  (CIGS),  use far less material  (though they  use more glass), but account for less than 10% of the global solar market. Other thin-films, such as those based on perovskites, organic solar cells, or earth-abundant, non-toxic materials such as kesterites, either on </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4837">their own, or layered on silicon, could further reduce material use per energy produced.

Recycling allows the reuse of nearly all - 83% in one study - of the components of PV modules,  other  than  plastics  (Ardente  et  al.  2019)  and  would  add  less  than  1%  to  lifecycle  GHG emissions (Latunussa et al. 2016). Glass accounts for 70% of the mass of a solar cell and is relatively easy to recycle. Recycling technology is advancing, but the scale and share of recycling is still small (Li et al. 2020d). By 2050, however, end-of-life PV could total 80 MT and comprise 10% of global electronic waste (Stolz and Frischknecht 2017), although most of it is glass. IEA runs a program to enable PV recycling by sharing best practices to minimise recycling life cycle impacts. Ensuring that a substantial  amount  of  panels  are  recycled  at  end  of  life  will  likely  require  policy  incentives,  as  the market value of the recovered materials, aside from aluminium and copper, is likely to be too low to justify  recycling  on  its  own  (Deng  et  al.  2019).  A  near-term  priority  is maximizing the  recovery of silver, silicon, and aluminium, the most valuable PV material components (Heath et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id4976"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4977">Many  alternative  PV  materials  are  improving  in  efficiency  and  stability,  providing  longer-term pathways for continued PV costs reductions and better performance (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4979">high confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4980">). While solar PV based on  semi-conductors constructed  from  wafers of  silicon  still  captures  90% of  the market,  new designs and materials have the potential to reduce costs further, increase efficiency, reduce resource use, and open new applications. The most significant technological advance within silicon PV in the past ten years has been the widespread adoption of the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) design (Green 2015), which now accounts for the majority of production. This advance boosts efficiency over traditional  aluminium  backing  by  increasing  reflectivity  within  the  cell  and  reducing  electron  hole recombination (Blakers 2019). Bifacial modules increase efficiency by using reflected light from the ground or roof on the backside of modules (Guerrero-Lemus et al. 2016). Integrating PV into buildings can reduce overall costs and improve building energy performance (Shukla et al. 2016). Concentrating PV  uses  lenses  or  mirrors that  collect  and  concentrate  light  onto  high  efficiency  PV  cells  (Li  et  al. 2020a).  Beyond  crystalline  silicon,  thin  films  of  amorphous  silicon,  cadmium  telluride,  and  copper indium gallium selenide (among others) have the potential for much lower costs while their efficiencies have increased (Green et al. 2019). Perovskites, inexpensive and easy to produce crystalline structures, have increased in efficiency by a factor of six in the past decade; the biggest challenge is light-induced degradation as well as finding lead-free efficient compounds or establish lead recycling at the end of the life cycle of the device (Petrus et al. 2017; Chang et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019b; Zhu et al. 2020). Organic solar cells are made of carbon-based semiconductors like the ones found in the displays made from organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and can be processed in thin films on large areas with scalable and fast coating processes on plastic substrates. The main challenges are raising the efficiency and  improving  their  lifetime  (Ma  et  al.  2020;  Riede  et  al.  2021).  Quantum  dots,  spherical  semi-conductor  nano-crystals,  can  be  tuned  to  absorb  specific  wavelengths  of  sunlight  giving  them  the potential for high efficiency with very little material use (Kramer et al. 2015). A common challenge for all emerging solar cell technologies is developing the corresponding production equipment. Hybrids of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5005">silicon with layers of quantum dots and perovskites have the potential to take advantage of the benefits of all three, although those designs require that these new technologies have stability and scale that match those of silicon (Palmstrom et al. 2019; Chang et al. 2017). This broad array of alternatives to making PV from crystalline silicon offer realistic potential for lower costs, reduced material use, and higher efficiencies in future years (Victoria et al. 2021). </span></div><div style="" id="id5011"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5012">Besides PV, alternative solar technologies exist, including CSP, which can provide special services in high-temperature  heat  and  diurnal  storage,  even  if  it  is  more  costly  than  PV  and  its  potential  for deployment is limited.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5016">CSP uses reflective surfaces, such as parabolic mirrors, to focus sunlight on a receiver to heat a working fluid, which is subsequently transformed into electricity (Islam et al. 2018). </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5019">Solar  heating  and  cooling  are  also  well  established  technologies,  and  solar  energy  can  be  utilized directly for domestic or commercial applications such as drying, heating, cooling, and cooking (Ge et al.  2018).

In addition, research proceeds on space-based solar PV, which takes advantage of high insolation and a continuous solar resource (Kelzenberg et al. 2018), but faces the formidable obstacle of developing safe, efficient, and inexpensive microwave or laser transmission to the Earth&#8217;s surface (Yang et al. 2016). CSP is the most widely adopted of  these alternative solar technologies. </span></div><div style="" id="id5140"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5141">Like PV, CSP facilities can deliver large amounts of power (up to 200 MW per unit) and maintain substantial thermal storage, which is valuable for load balancing over the diurnal cycle (McPherson et al. 2020). However, unlike PV, CSP can only use direct sunlight, constraining its cost-effectiveness to North Africa, the Middle East, Southern Africa, Australia, the Western U.S., parts of South America (Peru, Chile), the Western part of China, and Australia (Deng et al. 2015; Dupont et al. 2020). Parabolic troughs, central towers and parabolic dishes are the three leading solar thermal technologies (Wang et al. 2017d). Parabolic troughs represented approximately 70% of new capacity in 2018 with the balance made up by central tower plants (Islam et al. 2018). Especially promising research directions are on tower-based designs that can achieve high temperatures, useful for industrial heat and energy storage (Mehos et al. 2017), and direct steam generation designs (Islam et al. 2018). Costs of CSP have fallen by nearly half since AR5 (Figure 6.8) albeit at a slower rate than PV.

Studies  have  suggested  that  &#8216;bottom-up&#8217;  approaches  may  overestimate  technical  potentials (Miller et al. 2015; Kleidon and Miller 2020). But even in the most conservative &#8216;top-down&#8217; approaches, the technical wind potential surpasses the amount needed to limit warming to well below 2&#176;C (Bosch et al. 2017; Eurek et al. 2017; Volker et al. 2017). The projected climate change mitigation from wind energy by 2100 ranges from 0.3&#176;C&#8211;0.8&#176;C depending on the precise socio-economic pathway and wind energy  expansion  scenario  followed  (Barthelmie  and  Pryor  2021).  Wind  resources  are  unevenly distributed over the globe and by time of the year (Petersen and Troen 2012), but potential hotspots exist on every continent (Figure 6.10) as expressed by the wind power density (a quantitative measure of  wind  energy  available  at  any  location).  Technical  potentials  for  onshore  wind  power  vary considerably, often because of inconsistent assessments of suitability factors (McKenna et al. 2020). The potential for offshore wind power is larger than for onshore because offshore wind is stronger and less variable (Bosch et al. 2018). Offshore wind is more expensive, however, because of higher costs for construction, maintenance, and transmission. Wind power varies at a range of time scales, from annual to sub-seconds; the effects of local short-term variability can be offset by power plant control, flexible grid integration, and storage (Barra et al. 2021) (section 6.4.3). In some regions, interannual variations in wind energy resources could be important for optimal power system design (Wohland et al. 2019a; Coker et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id5298"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id5299">Figure 6.10 Mean wind power density [W m</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id5300">-2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id5301">] at 100 m above ground level over land and within 100 km </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id5303">of the coastline.

All major onshore wind markets have experienced rapid growth in both rotor diameter (from 81.2 m in 2010 to 120 m in 2020) (IRENA 2021b), and average power ratings (from 1.9 MW in 2010 to 3 MW in 2020). The generation capacity of offshore wind turbines grew by  a factor of 3.7 in less than two decades,  from  1.6  MW  in  2000  to  6  MW  in  2020  (Wiser  et  al.  2021).  Floating  foundations  could revolutionize offshore wind power by tapping into the abundant wind potential in deeper waters. This technology  is  particularly  important  for  regions  where  coastal  waters  are  too  deep  for fixed-bottom wind turbines. Floating wind farms potentially offer economic and environmental benefits compared with fixed-bottom designs due to less-invasive activity on the seabed during installation, but the long-term  ecological  effects  are  unknown  and  meteorological  conditions  further  offshore  and  in  deeper waters are harsher on wind turbine components (IRENA 2019c). A radical new class of wind energy converters has also been conceived under the name of Airborne Wind Energy Systems that can harvest strong, high-altitude winds (typically between 200&#8211;800m), which are inaccessible by traditional wind turbines (Cherubini et al. 2015). This technology has seen development and testing of small devices (Watson et al. 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id5482"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5483">Wind capacity factors have increased over the last decade (Figure 6.11).

This has been driven by the increased share of offshore development in China, where projects are often near-shore and use smaller wind turbines than  in  Europe  (IRENA  2021b).  Improvements  in  capacity  factors  also  come  from  increased functionality of wind turbines and wind farms. Manufactures can adapt the wind turbine generator to the wind conditions. Turbines for windy sites have smaller generators and smaller specific capacity per rotor area, and therefore operate more efficiently and reach full capacity for a longer time period (Rohrig et al. 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id5493"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5494">Electricity from onshore wind is less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels in a growing number of markets (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5496">high confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5497">).

The impacts on animal habitats and collisions can be resolved or reduced by  selectively  stopping  some  wind  turbines  in  high  risk  locations,  often  without  affecting  the productivity of the wind farm (de Lucas et al. 2012). Many countries now require environmental studies of impacts of wind turbines on wildlife prior to project development, and, in some regions, shutdowns are required during active bird migration (de Lucas et al. 2012). Offshore wind farms can also impact migratory  birds  and  other  sea  species  (Hooper  et  al.  2017).  Floating  foundations  pose  lower environmental  impacts  at  build  stage  (IRENA  2019c),  but  their  cumulative  long-term  impacts  are unclear (Goodale and Milman 2016).

Yet, some people believe wind turbines can cause  noise  and  visual  aesthetic  pollution,  threaten  places  of  symbolic  value  (Russell  et  al.  2020; Devine-Wright and Wiersma 2020), and have adverse effects on wildlife (Bates and Firestone 2015), which challenges public acceptability (Rand and Hoen 2017). Support for local wind projects is higher when people believe fair decision-making procedures have been implemented (Aitken 2010a; Dietz and Stern  2008).  Evidence  is  mixed  whether  distance  from  wind  turbines  or  financial  compensation increases public acceptability of wind turbines  (Hoen et al. 2019; Rand and Hoen 2017; Cass et al. 2010; Rudolph et al. 2018).

Dams may lead to fragmentation of ecological habitats because they act as barriers for migration of fish and other land and water-borne fauna, sediments, and water flow. These barriers can be mitigated by sediment passes and fish migration aids, and with provision of environmental flows. Below  dams,  there  can  be  considerable  alterations  to  vegetation,  natural  river  flows,  retention  of sediments and nutrients, and water quality and temperature. Construction of large reservoirs leads to loss  of  land,  which  may  result  in  social  and  environmental  consequences.  Minimizing  societal  and environmental  impacts  requires  taking  into  account  local  physical,  environmental,  climatological, social, economic, and political aspects during the planning stage (Killingtveit 2020). Moreover, when large  areas  of  land  are  flooded  by  dam  construction,  they  generate  GHGs  (Phyoe  and  Wang  2019; Maavara et al. 2020; Prairie et al. 2018). On the other hand, hydropower provides flexible, competitive low-emission  electricity,  local  economic  benefits  (e.g.,  by  increasing  irrigation  and  electricity production in developing countries), and ancillary services such as municipal water supply, irrigation and drought management, navigation and recreation, and flood control (IRENA 2021b). However, the long term economic benefits to communities affected by reservoirs are a subject of debate  (de Faria et al. 2017; Catolico et al. 2021). </span></div><div style="" id="id6230"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6231">Public support for hydroelectric energy is generally high (Steg 2018), and higher than support for coal, gas,  and  nuclear.

Public support is generally high for small and medium scale hydropower in regions where hydropower was historically used (Gormally et al. 2014). Additionally, there is high support for existing large hydropower projects in Switzerland (Plum et al. 2019; Rudolf et al. 2014), Canada (Boyd et al. 2019), and Norway (Karlstr&#248;m and Ryghaug 2014), where it is a trusted and common energy source. Public  support  seems  lower  for  new  hydropower  projects  (Hazboun  and  Boudet  2020),  and  the construction  of  new  large  hydropower  plants  has  been  met  with  strong  resistance  in  some  areas (Bronfman et al., 2015; Vince, 2010). People generally perceive hydroelectric energy as clean and a non-contributor to climate change and environmental pollution (Kaldellis et al. 2013). For example, in Sweden, people believed that existing hydropower projects have as few negative environmental impacts </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6246">as solar, and even less than wind (Ek 2005). However, in areas where the construction of new large-scale hydroelectric energy is met with resistance, people believe that electricity generation from hydro can cause environmental, social, and personal risks (Bronfman et al., 2012; Kaldellis et al., 2013).  </span></div><div style="" id="id6262"/><div style="" id="id6375"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6376">The construction time of hydroelectric power plants is longer than many other renewable technologies, and that construction time may be extended by the additional time it takes to fill the reservoir. This extended timeline can create  uncertainty in the completion  of  the  project.  The  uncertainty  is  due  to insecurity in year-to-year variations in precipitation and the water inflows required to fill reservoirs. This is especially critical in the case of trans-boundary hydroelectric power plants, where filling up the reservoirs can have large implications on downstream users in other nations. As a result of social and environmental  constraints,  only  a  small  fraction  of  potential  economic  hydropower  projects  can  be developed,  especially  in  developed  countries.  Many  developing  countries  have  major  undeveloped hydropower  potential,  and  there  are  opportunities  to  develop  hydropower  combined  with  other economic  activities  such  as  irrigation  (Lacombe  et  al.  2014).

Construction times have exceeded 13&#8211;15 years and cost has surpassed 3&#8211;4 times initial budget estimates (OECD IEA NEA 2020). In contrast, most of the recent projects in Eastern Asia (with construction starts from 2012) were implemented within 5&#8211;6 years  (IAEA PRIS 2021). In addition to region-specific factors, future nuclear costs will depend on the ability to benefit from the accumulated experience in controlling the main drivers of cost. These cost drivers fall into four categories: design maturity, project management, regulatory stability and predictability, and multi-unit  and  series  effects  (NEA  2020).

However, new reactor designs with passive and enhanced safety systems reduce the risk of such accidents significantly (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6635">high confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6636">). The (normal) activity of a nuclear reactor results in low volumes of radioactive waste, which requires strictly controlled and regulated disposal. On a global scale, roughly 421 ktons of spent nuclear fuel have been produced since 1971 (IEA 2014). Out of this volume, 2&#8211;3% is high-level radioactive waste, which  presents  challenges  in  terms  of  radiotoxicity  and  decay  longevity,  and  ultimately  entails permanent disposal.  </span></div><div style="" id="id6643"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6644">Nuclear  energy  is  found  to  be  favourable  regarding  land  occupation  (Cheng  and  Hammond  2017; Luderer et al. 2019) and ecological impacts (Brook and Bradshaw 2015; Gibon et al. 2017). Similarly, bulk material requirements per unit of energy produced are low (e.g. aluminum, copper, iron, rare earth </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6648">metals)  (Vidal  et  al.  2013;  Luderer  et  al.  2019).  Water-intensive  inland  nuclear  power  plants  may contribute  to  localized  water  stress  and  competition  for  water  uses.  The  choice  of  cooling  systems (closed-loop instead of once-through) can significantly moderate withdrawal rates of the freshwater (Jin et al. 2019; Fricko et al. 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Meldrum et al. 2013). Reactors situated on the seashore are not affected by water scarcity issues (JRC EU 2021). Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies suggest that the overall impacts on human health (in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) from the normal operation of nuclear power plants are substantially lower than those caused by fossil fuel  technologies  and are  comparable  to  renewable  energy  sources  (Treyer  et  al.  2014;  Gibon et  al. 2017). </span></div><div style="" id="id6658"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6659">Nuclear power continues to suffer from limited public and political support in some countries (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6660">high confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6662">).  Public  support  for  nuclear  energy  is  consistently  lower  than  for  renewable  energy  and natural  gas,  and  in  many  countries  as  low  as  support  for  energy  from  coal  and  oil  (Hobman  and </span></div><div style="" id="id6677"/>

The major nuclear accidents (i.e. Three Mile Island, Chernobyl,  and  Fukushima)  decreased  public  support  (Poortinga  et  al.  2013;  Bird  et  al.  2014).  The public  remains  concerned  about  the  safety  risks  of  nuclear  power  plants  and  radioactive  materials (Tsujikawa et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2014; Pampel 2011). At the same time, some groups see nuclear energy as a reliable energy source, beneficial for the economy and helpful in climate change mitigation. Public support for nuclear energy is higher when people are concerned about energy security, including concerns about the availability of energy and high energy prices (Gupta et al. 2019b; Groot et al. 2013), and when they expect local benefit (Wang et al. 2020c). Public support also increases when trust in managing bodies is higher (de Groot and Steg 2011). Similarly, transparent and participative decision-making processes enhance perceived procedural fairness and public support (Sjoberg 2004). </span></div><div style="" id="id6802"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6803">Because of the sheer scale of the investment required (individual projects can exceed USD 10 billion in value), nearly 90% of nuclear power plants under construction are run by state-owned or controlled companies with governments assuming significant part of the risks and costs. For countries that choose nuclear power in their energy portfolio, stable political conditions and support, clear regulatory regimes, and adequate financial framework are crucial for successful and efficient implementation.  </span></div><div style="" id="id6809"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6810">Many countries have adopted technology-specific policies for low-carbon energy courses, and these policies  influence  the  competitiveness  of  nuclear  power.  For  example,  feed-in-tariffs  and  feed-in premiums  for  renewables  widely  applied  in  the  EU  (Kitzing  et  al.  2012)  or  renewable  portfolio standards in the U.S. (Barbose et al. 2016) impact wholesale electricity price (leading occasionally to low or even negative prices), which affects the revenues of existing nuclear and other plants (Bruninx et al. 2013; Newbery et al. 2018; Lesser 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id6817"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6818">Nuclear power&#8217;s long-term viability may hinge on demonstrating to the public and investors that there is a long-term solution to spent nuclear fuel. Evidence from countries steadily progressing towards first final disposals - Finland, Sweden and France - suggests that broad political support, coherent nuclear waste  policies,  and  a  well-managed,  consensus-based  decision-making  process  are  critical  for accelerating this process (Metlay 2016). Proliferation concerns surrounding nuclear power are related to fuel cycle (i.e., uranium enrichment and spent fuel processing). These processes are implemented in a very limited number of countries following strict national and internationals norms and rules, such as IAEA guidelines, treaties, and conventions. Most of the countries which might introduce nuclear power in the future for their climate change mitigation benefits do not envision developing their own full fuel cycle, significantly reducing any risks that might be linked to proliferation (IAEA 2014, 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id6829"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6830">6.4.2.5  Carbon Dioxide Capture, Utilization, and Storage </span></div><div style="" id="id6832"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6833">Since AR5, there have been increased efforts to develop novel platforms that reduce the energy penalty associated with CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id6835">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6836"> capture, develop CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id6837">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6838"> utilization pathways as a substitute to geologic storage, and establish global policies to support CCS (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6840">high confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6841">).

Governments incentivize such operations through a number of emissions trading and offset programs (Haya et al. 2020). Methane emissions in the oil and gas sector can be reduced by leak detection and repair, relevant across varying time scales (hours to decades) and regional scopes (component/facility level to continental) (Fox et al. 2019).

The  greatest advantage of most marine energy, excluding wave energy, is that their sources are highly regular and predictable, and energy can be furthermore generated both day and night. An additional use of sea water is to develop lower-cost district cooling systems near the sea (Hunt et al. 2019). The greatest barrier to most marine  technology  advances is the relatively high  upfront  costs,  uncertainty  on  environmental regulation and impact, need for investments and insufficient infrastructure (Kempener and Neumann </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id9927">2014a,b).

Thermal (incineration, gasification, and pyrolysis) and biological (anaerobic  digestion  and  landfill  gas  to  energy)  technologies  are  commonly  used  (Ahmad  et  al. 2020).When  WTE  technologies  are  equipped  with  proper  air  pollution  reduction  facilities  they  can contribute to clean electricity production and reduction of GHG emissions.

Incineration plants can reduce the mass of waste by 70%-80% and the volume of waste by 80%-90% (Haraguchi et al. 2019). Incineration technology can reduce water and soil pollution (Gu et al., 2019).

Anaerobic  digestion  technology  has  a  positive environmental  impact  and  the  ability  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  (Ayodele  et  al.  2018;  Cudjoe  et  al. 2020).  The by-product of the anaerobic digestion process could be used as a nutrient-rich fertilizer for enhancing soil richness for agricultural purposes (Wainaina et al. 2020). Due to the potential negative impacts on domestic environment and residents&#8217; health, WTE projects such as incineration encounter substantial opposition from the local communities in which they are located (Ren et al., 2016; Baxter et al., 2016). Therefore, for WTE to be deployed more widely, policies would need to be tailored with specific guidelines focused on mitigating emissions, which may have adverse effect on the environment. </span></div><div style="" id="id10093"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10094">Depending on the origin of the waste used, the integration of WTE and carbon capture and storage (CCS) could enable waste to be a net zero or even net negative emissions energy source (Kearns 2019; Wienchol et al. 2020). For example, in Europe only, the integration of CCS with WTE facilities has the potential to capture about 60 to 70 million tons of carbon dioxide annually (Tota et al. 2021).  </span></div><div style="" id="id10099"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10100">Waste-to-energy is  an expensive  process  compared to  other  energy sources such  as  fossil fuels  and natural gas (Mohammadi and Harjunkoski 2020).
